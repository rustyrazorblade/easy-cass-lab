/**
 * Abstract base class providing common SystemD service management functionality.
 *
 * This class implements the shared logic for managing SystemD services via SSH,
 * eliminating code duplication across service-specific implementations. Each concrete
 * service only needs to specify its service name and can optionally override methods
 * for custom behavior.
 *
 * All operations use systemctl commands executed over SSH via RemoteOperationsService.
 * User-facing output is handled through OutputHandler, while detailed logging uses
 * the service-specific logger.
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```
 * class MyService(
 *     remoteOps: RemoteOperationsService,
 *     outputHandler: OutputHandler
 * ) : AbstractSystemDServiceManager("my-service", remoteOps, outputHandler) {
 *     override val log: KLogger = KotlinLogging.logger {}
 *
 *     // Optionally override methods for custom behavior
 *     override fun restart(host: Host): Result<Unit> = runCatching {
 *         // Custom restart logic here
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @property serviceName The name of the SystemD service (e.g., "cassandra", "cassandra-sidecar")
 * @property remoteOps Service for executing SSH commands on remote hosts
 * @property outputHandler Handler for user-facing output messages
