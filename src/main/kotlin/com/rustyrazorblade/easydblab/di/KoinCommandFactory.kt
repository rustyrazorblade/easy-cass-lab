 * PicoCLI factory that uses Koin for dependency injection.
 *
 * This enables PicoCLI to instantiate command classes while Koin
 * provides their dependencies (Context, services, etc.).
 *
 * Commands are registered as factories in Koin (via CommandsModule)
 * to ensure a fresh instance is created for each execution, which
 * is important for the REPL and MCP server.
 *
 * For classes not registered in Koin (like parent Runnable commands),
 * this factory falls back to PicoCLI's default factory.
