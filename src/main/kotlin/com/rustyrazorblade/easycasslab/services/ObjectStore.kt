/**
 * Cloud-agnostic object storage interface for easy-cass-lab.
 *
 * This interface abstracts cloud storage operations to enable multi-cloud support.
 * Implementations exist for AWS S3, and future implementations can support:
 * - Google Cloud Storage (GCP)
 * - Azure Blob Storage
 * - Local filesystem (for testing/development)
 *
 * All operations use ClusterS3Path for type-safe path handling and proper cluster
 * namespacing. Note: ClusterS3Path will be renamed to ClusterStoragePath in a
 * future refactoring to be truly cloud-agnostic.
 *
 * Implementations should:
 * - Use retry logic for transient failures (network issues, throttling)
 * - Provide user feedback via OutputHandler when showProgress is true
 * - Handle provider-specific exceptions and convert to appropriate types
 * - Support cluster-specific namespacing through ClusterS3Path
 *
 * Example usage:
 * ```kotlin
 * val objectStore: ObjectStore by inject()
 * val s3Path = clusterState.s3Path(userConfig).sparkJars().resolve("myapp.jar")
 * val result = objectStore.uploadFile(localJar, s3Path, showProgress = true)
 * ```
