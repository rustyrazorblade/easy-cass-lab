This is the manual for easy-cass-lab, a provisioning tool for Apache Cassandra designed for developers looking to benchmark and test Apache Cassandra.  It assists with builds and starting instances on AWS.

If you are looking for a tool to aid in benchmarking these clusters please see the companion project
https://github.com/rustyrazorblade/easy-cass-stress[easy-cass--stress].

If you're looking for tools to help manage Cassandra in _production_ environments please see the http://cassandra-reaper.io/[Reaper] project and https://github.com/spotify/cstar[cstar]

== Prerequisites

- An AWS access key and secret.  easy-cass-lab uses https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] to create and destroy instances.  You will be prompted for these the first time you start easy-cass-lab.
- The access key needs permissions to create an S3 bucket as well as create SSH keys.  Separate keys are used by default for security reasons.

== Installation

The current version is {EASY_CASS_LAB_VERSION}.


==== Tarball Install

If you're using mac, for now you'll need to grab our tarball using:

[subs="attributes"]
```
$ curl -L -O "https://dl.bintray.com/rustyrazorblade/tlp-tools-tarball/easy-cass-lab-{EASY_CASS_LAB_VERSION}.tar"
$ tar -xzf easy-cass-lab-{EASY_CASS_LAB_VERSION}.tar
```

To get started, add the bin directory of easy-cass-lab to your $PATH.  For example:

[source,bash]
----
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/easy-cass-lab/bin"
cd /path/to/easy-cass-lab
./gradlew assemble
----

== Setup

We currently have a dependency on shell scripts meaning you'll need a Mac or Linux box to use this tool.

If you've never used to the tool before, the first time you run a command you'll be asked to supply some information,
which will generate a configuration file which will be placed in your `$HOME/.easy-cass-lab/profiles/default/settings.yaml`.

IMPORTANT: We currently only support the Ubuntu 21 ami.

Running the command without any arguments will print out the usage:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab
----

You'll see the help.  It looks like this:

```
include::includes/help.txt[]
```

== Initialize a Cluster

The tool uses the current working directory as a working space for all the cluster configs and artifacts.

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab init
----

This will initialize the current directory with a terraform.tf.json. You can open this up in an editor.
Here you can change the number of nodes in the cluster, as well as configure the number of stress nodes you want.
You can also change the instance type.
Generally speaking though, you shouldn't have to do this.
If you find yourself doing it often, please submit an https://github.com/rustyrazorblade/easy-cass-lab/issues[issue]
describing your requirements and we'll work with you to solve the problem.

If you're using a Graviton AMI, you'll need to supply the `--cpu arm64` flag when running `init`.

== Launch Instances

Launch your instances with the following:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab up
----

Terraform will eventually ask you to type `yes` and fire up your instances.  Optionally you can pass `--yes` to the `-up` command and you won't be prompted.

easy-cass-lab will create a file, `env.sh`, which has helpful aliases and bash functions that will help you run your cluster.  Run the following:

[source,bash]
----
source env.sh
----

This will set up SSH, SCP, SFTP, and rsync to use a local sshConfig file, as well as some other helpful aliases.

SSH alises for all Cassandra nodes are automatically created as `c0`-`cN`.  `ssh` is not required.  For example:

`c0 nodetool status`

In addition, the following are defined:

* *c-all* executes a command on every node in the cluster sequentially.
* *c-collect-artifacts* will collect metrics, nodetool output and system information into the artifacts directory.  It takes a name as a parameter.  This is useful when doing performance testing to capture the state of the system at a given moment.
* *c-start* Starts cassandra on all nodes.
* *c-restart* Restarts cassandra on all nodes.  Not a graceful operation.  To test true rolling restarts we recommend using https://github.com/spotify/cstar[cstar].
* *c-status*: Executes `nodetool status` on cassandra0.
* *c-tpstats*: Executes `nodetool tpstats` on all nodes.


== Installing Cassandra

=== The Easy Way - Use a Released Build

The easiest path forward to getting a cluster up and running is the following:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab use 3.11.4
easy-cass-lab install
easy-cass-lab start
----

Simply replace 3.11.4 with the release version.


=== The Hard Way - Use a custom Build

To install Cassandra on your instances, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Build the version you need and give it a build name (optional)
2. Tell easy-cass-lab to use the custom build

The first step is optional because you may already have a build in the `~/.easy-cass-lab/build` directory that you want to use.

If you have no builds you will need to run the following:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab build -n BUILD_NAME /path/to/repo
----

Where:

* `BUILD_NAME` - Name you want to give the build e.g. my-build-cass-4.0.
* `/path/to/repo` - Full path to clone of the Cassandra repository.

If you already have a build that you would like to use you can run the following:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab use BUILD_NAME
----

This will copy the binaries and configuration files to the `provisioning/cassandra` directory in your `easy-cass-lab` repository. The `provisioning` directory contains a number of files that can be used to set up your instances. Being realistic, since we do so much non-standard work (EBS vs instance store, LVM vs FS directly on a device, caches, etc) we need the ability to run arbitrary commands. This isnâ€™t a great use case for puppet / chef / salt / ansible (yet), so we are just using easy to modify scripts for now.

If you want to install other binaries or perform other operations during provisioning of the instances, you can add them to the `provisioning/cassandra` directory. Note that any new scripts you add should be prefixed with a number which is used to determine the order they are executed by the `install.sh` script.

To provision the instances run the following:

[source,bash]
----
easy-cass-lab install
----

Where:

* `SSH_KEY_PATH` - Is the full path to the private key from the key pair used when creating the instances.

This will push the contents of the `provisioning/cassandra` directory up to each of the instances you have created and install Cassandra on them.


The following ports are open:

|Port|Purpose
|9042|Cassandra Native Protocol (cql)

the normal ports are all mapped for you so you can reach prometheus on 9090 and grafana on 3000
