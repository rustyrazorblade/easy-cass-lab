# easy-db-lab

This is the manual for easy-db-lab, a provisioning tool for Apache Cassandra designed for developers looking to benchmark and test Apache Cassandra. It assists with builds and starting instances on AWS.

If you are looking for a tool to aid in benchmarking these clusters please see the companion project [cassandra-easy-stress](https://github.com/apache/cassandra-easy-stress).

If you're looking for tools to help manage Cassandra in *production* environments please see [Reaper](http://cassandra-reaper.io/), [cstar](https://github.com/spotify/cstar), and [K8ssandra](https://docs.k8ssandra.io/).

## Quick Start

1. [Install easy-db-lab](getting-started/installation.md)
2. [Set up your environment](getting-started/setup.md)
3. [Initialize a cluster](user-guide/cluster-initialization.md)
4. [Launch instances](user-guide/launching-instances.md)
5. [Install Cassandra](user-guide/installing-cassandra.md)
